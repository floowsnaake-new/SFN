shining force neo Door mod



This program written in C to help me learn as i go the program is designed to modify the game's memory running PCSX2 to open a closed door in Shining Force Neo. It works by injecting altering specific memory addresses that control the door's state.

By setting the relevant memory value to indicate an "open" state, the program effectively bypasses the door's closed condition, allowing the player to pass through freely.

This method leverages knowledge of the game's internal memory structure and is typically implemented through cheat engines or memory editing tools within the emulator.

This C program was written in and for Linux Debian as a example mostly for myself.

Make the Program Executable:
chmod +x OpenDoor

Run the Program:
./OpenDoor
